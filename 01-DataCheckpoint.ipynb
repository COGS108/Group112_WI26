    "  - Visitor hours: used to construct a new variable. Average time spent per visit = recreation vistior hours/recreation visits. This will provides a proxy for visit length since the dataset does not directly report average duration\n",
    "  - Year & Month: is to analyze trends over time, create season varaibles\n",
    "     - Winter:Dec-Feb\n",
    "     - Spring:Mar-May\n",
    "     - Summer:Jun-Aug\n",
    "     - Fall:Sep-Nov\n",
    "  - Park Name used as a unique identifier to merge with external dadtasets (region, park type, weather)\n",
    "  - Overnight stays:can be used additional measure of park use and to distinguish between day use and overnight visitation patterns\n",
    "  - Non-recreation visits: will not be used in the main visitation measure because they include commuting and administrative use rather than tourism-related visits\n",
    "  - Shortcomings is vistiations does not mean unique visitations, the dataset only takes into account of recreation visits not individual people. We cannot measure number of unique visitors and repeat visitation behavior.\n",
    "  - There is no direction \"average length of stay\" because we only have recreation vistiro hours and recreation visits so we must construct average stay = vistiors hours/visits. This assumes that all visitor hours come form recreation visitors and reporitng is accruate accross parks\n",
    "  - There is no visor characterisitcs, can not anaylze differences by age, income, residency (local vs toruosits), group size, transportation mode. So the analysis is limited to park patterns not people.\n",
    "  - There is no weather in the dataset, you cannot directly measure temperature, rain, snow and extreme events, so you cannot test weather effects unless you merge naother dataset\n",
    "  - Potential differences in counting methods across parks. They may use different tools like traffic counters, fee recipts, or manual estimates which can create inconsistency in visitation estimates especially for older data\n",
    "  - Some missing or suppressed data: for certain praks or early years: some months may be missing, some overnight categories may be blank.\n",
    "  - Measures park-level use, not specific activites: Based on the dataset we won't be able to tell from hiking vs camping vs sightseeing, or which areas insidee the park are crowded \n"

    "   1. Describe the important metrics, what units they are in, and giv some sense of what they mean.  For example \"Fasting blood glucose in units of mg glucose per deciliter of blood.  Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",

    "    2. make the dataset tidy or demonstrate that it was already tidy\n",
    "    3. demonstrate the size of the dataset\n",
    "    4. find out how much data is missing, where its missing, and if its missing at random or seems to have any systematic relationships in its missingness\n",
    "    5. find and flag any outliers or suspicious entries\n",
    "    6. clean the data or demonstrate that it was already clean.  You may choose how to deal with missingness (dropna of fillna... how='any' or 'all') and you should justify your choice in some way\n",
    "    7. You will load raw data from `data/00-raw/`, you will (optionally) write intermediate stages of your work to `data/01-interim` and you will write the final fully wrangled version of your data to `data/02-processed`\n",
    "4. Optionally you can also show some summary statistics for variables that you think are important to the project\n",
