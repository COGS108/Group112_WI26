    "As a team, the famous U.S National Parks grabbed our attention during the process of selecting a topic. We believed that there were many interesting datasets and analysis that could be made regarding this topic. The U.S National Parks are spread among different states. However, they are different in many aspects. For instance, some national parks are more populated and easily accessible, while some are in less populated areas and are harder to get to. Each region's national park has its own unique features. Generally speaking, National Parks that are located near the major cities will be more accessible than the ones that are located in the more remote areas, which the latter will require greater effort and planning to visit. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the regional difference, National Parks also have seasonal differences. Each national park has its own peak and off-season based on what tourists plan to do there. These factors greatly influence tourists in deciding whether they choose to visit which national park and the duration of their stay there. Hence, this project aims to explore how regional and seasonal differences in the US National Parks from 2000 to 2024 affect recreational visitation and hours spent per visit. \n",
    "\n",
    "A report by the National Park Service (NPS) shows that the reported number of recreational visits is 331.9 million in the year 2024, with visitors spending approximately 1.4 billion hours in national parks.<a name=\"ref1\"></a>[1](#footnote1) Additionally, visitors distributed their visits throughout the year, where more than half of the parks show peak periods in February to June, and October to December. This shows that the peak season is during spring and fall which is the opposite to popular belief that the peak season is summertime. Instead, tourists visit throughout the year in different periods, and over half of the park shows that spring and fall had an above-average number of visits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The National Park Service also found out that climate change not only affects resources of national parks, but they discovered that it influenced visitation patterns. Their data shows that 95% of parks has great relationship between air temperature and visitation.<a name=\"ref2\"></a>[2](#footnote2) Visitation declines as the monthly average temperature is over 80F. This shows that a lot of the park visitors avoid hot weather, which leads to this phenomenon.\n",
    "\n",
    "A report from the NPS in 2021 shows that the most visited national park is the Great Smoky Mountain National Park with 14 million recreation visits, with Zion National Park in second with 5 million recreation visits.<a name=\"ref3\"></a>[3](#footnote3) The main reason why the Great Smoky Mountain National Park is so popular is due to its geographical location. It is located within a day's drive for most US population including cities like Chicago, Atlanta, Nashville, etc. Which made it very easy and accessible for a wide range of the population to visit without having to drive too far.<a name=\"ref4\"></a>[4](#footnote4)\n",

    "  - Overnight stays:can be used additional measure of park use and to distinguish between day use and overnight visitation patterns\n",
    "  - Non-recreation visits: will not be used in the main visitation measure because they include commuting and administrative use rather than tourism-related visits\n",
    "  - Shortcomings is vistiations does not mean unique visitations, the dataset only takes into account of recreation visits not individual people. We cannot measure number of unique visitors and repeat visitation behavior.\n",
    "  - There is no direction \"average length of stay\" because we only have recreation vistiro hours and recreation visits so we must construct average stay = vistiors hours/visits. This assumes that all visitor hours come form recreation visitors and reporitng is accruate accross parks\n",
    "  - There is no visor characterisitcs, can not anaylze differences by age, income, residency (local vs toruosits), group size, transportation mode. So the analysis is limited to park patterns not people.\n",
    "  - There is no weather in the dataset, you cannot directly measure temperature, rain, snow and extreme events, so you cannot test weather effects unless you merge naother dataset\n",
    "  - Potential differences in counting methods across parks. They may use different tools like traffic counters, fee recipts, or manual estimates which can create inconsistency in visitation estimates especially for older data\n",
    "  - Some missing or suppressed data: for certain praks or early years: some months may be missing, some overnight categories may be blank.\n",
    "  - Measures park-level use, not specific activites: Based on the dataset we won't be able to tell from hiking vs camping vs sightseeing, or which areas insidee the park are crowded \n"

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "> This project will use publicly available National Park Service (NPS) data, which is aggregated at the park level. A potential source of bias is that visitation counts may be influenced by factors like park accessibility, errors in recording, or park size. We will be careful not to interpret differences in visitation as reflecting individual visitor preferences.\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> A potential downstream risk is that results could be misinterpreted as reflecting individual preferences or behaviors. To mitigate this, we will frame our findings as park-level trends and avoid making claims about individual decision-making or protected groups.\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our analysis focuses on visitation counts and camping participation and doesn't include qualitative visitor experiences, environmental impacts, or local community perspectives.\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our chosen dataset may reflect bias toward more popular or accessible parks as they tend to have more data collection systems. Smaller parks may have less accurate visitation estimates or records, which could affect regional comparisons.\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We will use descriptive metrics such as visitation counts and recreation hours to examine park-level trends. We will also consider using derived measures such as average recreation hours per visit to provide context. These metrics are intended to describe patterns rather than evaluate performance or rank parks.\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We would specify that the metrics and variables that we are analyzing in our data isn't a metric that is used to measure park popularity or visitation satisfaction, and this results should not be interpreted as evidence of how environmental conditions affects recreational behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Since this project will most likely become public after we are completed, we will monitor the results by looking through comments of people that looked through our project and feedback from other collaborators. We would be paying most of our attention on feedbacks that indicated we have misinterpreted certain findings and make changes to ensure that our analysis is accurate\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> If we have users harmed by the results of our analysis we would quickly look into it as this matters a lot to us. We would correct our explanations, clairfy some limitation that we faced in our project, and revise our entire project and the parts that showed harm to users to ensure no harm is done.\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    "> If serious issues does happen, we would make the project private and revise everything that is necessary to ensure our project is accurate and non-harmful then we would make it public again.\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> A potential unintended use of this project is treating our analysis (visitation counts or recreation hours) as indicators of vistor satisfaction, or environment quality. To prevent this kind of unintended use we would specify in our project that all of our analysis is descriptive and focuses on trends that connects to our variable, rather than saying which park is better or not or trying to take this as an evidence as how enviromental variables connects to recreational behaviors.\n"
